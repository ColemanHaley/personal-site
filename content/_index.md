## Coleman Haley

I am a fourth year Ph.D. Student in the [CDT in Natural Language Processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), working with [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/) and [Edoardo Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/). My interests generally lie in issues pertaining to computational typology, typological diversity in NLP, low-resource languages, and the role of linguistic structure in NLP systems, particularly with respect to morphology.

Previously, I was an intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) with [Paul Smolensky](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/psmo/), where I worked on Tensor-Product-Representation-inspired methods of incorporating structure in neural models.

I graduated from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in 2020 with a double major in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I was advised by [Paul Smolensky](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/paul-smolensky/) and [Colin Wilson](https://colincwilson.github.io/), with whom I built more efficient Tensor Product Representation methods and interpretable neural morphological learners, respectively.

In my spare time, I enjoy advocating for the inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in STEM, baking, and embroidery. I really like the font *EB Garamond*.
