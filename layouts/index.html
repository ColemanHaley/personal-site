		<h2>Coleman Haley</h2>
		<div id="bio-text">
			<p>I am a recent graduate of the Johns Hopkins University (B.S. Computer Science + Cognitive Science). I work with Dr. Paul Smolensky and Dr. Colin Wilson on morphology, low-resource NLP, and neuro-symbolic computation.</p>
			<p>Currently, I am working as a contractor at Microsoft Research, where I am developing machine translation models for morphologically rich languages.</p>
			<p>Iâ€™m excited by solving problems for low-resource, typologically diverse languages in NLP, particularly by encorporating structure and/or linguistic information.</p>
			<p>In my spare time, I enjoy advocating for the inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in STEM, baking, and early music.</p>
